# Dynamic Resource Scaling using vNetRunner and MicroOpt

## Background Reading
For a brief overview of dynamic resource scaling, please see [intro-to-drs](intro-to-drs.md).

## 5G Dynamic Resource Scaling
 We will be conducting our hands-on sessions in room MC2061, which is equipped with VirtualBox and pre-loaded virtual machines (VMs) to facilitate the workshop. Once we have access to the VMs, we will be using JupyterLab for our exercises, which comes pre-installed in the provided VMs. Once you have accessed the VM, please proceed to the following repo to get started: [5GDynamicResourceAllocation](https://github.com/sulaimanalmani/5GDynamicResourceAllocation)

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Congratulations! By completing the three notebooks, you should now have a solid understanding of how the dataset gathered from 5G network can be used for network modeling and for 5G slice management and orchestration. 

## Key Takeaways:

- AI-based approaches can be effectively used for autonomous 5G network management and orchestration.
- You have learned how to train individual VNF models and compose them to form end-to-end slice model.
- You have learned how to leverage the network model and use primal-dual optimization to perform dynamic resource scaling for network slices.
